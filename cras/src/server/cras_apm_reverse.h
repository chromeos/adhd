 *        The reverse(playback) data goes through the DSP pipeline and
 *        eventually passes to this callback function in audio thread.
 *    process_needed_cb - Function provided by caller to check if reverse
 *        processing is needed. APM reverse module uses this to re-sync
 *        states with stream APMs in main thread.
 *    output_devices_changed_cb - Function provided by caller to handle the
