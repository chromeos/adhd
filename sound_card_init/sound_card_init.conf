# sound_card_init is a short-running process, but we don't start it as
# a task job, because sound_card_init needs the sound card to be ready in
# CRAS therefore we do not want to block the udev rule processing.

# Make the task killable, because if it has a leak it's better to
# restart it than to OOM-panic.
